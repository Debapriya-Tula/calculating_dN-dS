## Significance of dN/dS 

The dN/dS ratio is one of the most reliable measures of evolutionary pressures on protein-coding regions, and hence a key indicator of natural selection. <br><br>
Here we compare codon sequences  of two organisms and calculate their dN/dS value.

## How to run the program
1. Install the required modules using pip <br>
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the program <br>
`python3 dNdS.py`
3. To create an executable (filename.exe) for the program <br>
`pyinstaller --onefile --windowed dNdS.py`

We have included two files viz, `Ec_Modified1.txt`(to be uploaded first) and `Se_Modified1.txt` for two organisms. Their output file, `output.csv` is also included for reference.
